Name:    pubsub
Purpose: Simple publish & subscribe pattern in pure python (object designed).
         Messages can be posted by one ore more publishers on channels and
         subscribers can get those messages.

         Can be used in a threaded project to communicate asynchronously
         between light-weight process running in different threads.
         (see test case tests/test_pubsub_load.py for example)

Reference:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern
Requirement:  Python >= 3.6, [pytest, pylint, flake8, coverage]
Use pubsub version <= 0.3 for Python 2 compatibility

Modified:     v0.2 : 7 febr. 2018 by Thierry Maillard (Thierry46)
    - Embbed original version in a class to use it as an object in different
      file sources of your project.
    - Add more comments
    - Adapt unit tests written by Zhen Wang and add new ones
Modified:     v0.3 : 3 dec. 2020 by Thierry Maillard (Thierry46)
    - Add and correct comments
    - Add new test cases
    - Send an exception when too many messages in a channel.
Modified:     v0.4 : 20 dec. 2020 by Thierry Maillard (Thierry46)
    - just warn when queue overflows when publishing in a channel
    - implement PubSubPriority to register messages with priorities
    - only support Python >= 3.6 but not Python 2
    - improve quality metrics
    - remove listen method in main PubSub communicator class
      use ChanelQueue*.listen() instead.
    - replace functool.partial use by ChanelQueue* class
